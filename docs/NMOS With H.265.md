## Introduction

H.265 is a technology standardized in Rec. [ITU-T H.265][H.265] | ISO/IEC 23008 for video contribution at high compression rate and video quality.
A companion RTP payload format specification was developed through the IETF Payloads working group, IETF [RFC 7798][RFC-7798] for the transport of an H.265 bitstream over RTP.

The BCP-006-03 specification includes support for bitstreams that are compliant with the clauses of the main document and annexes A, B, C, D and E of the [ITU-T H.265][H.265] | ISO/IEC 23008 specification. It excludes support for bitstreams that are compliant with other annexes of the specification.
> Annex F (multi-layers extensions), Annex G (multiview high efficiency video coding), Annex H (scalable high efficiency video coding) and Annex I (3D high efficiency video coding) are not supported.

The [ITU H.222][H.222] specification and associated amendments describe the embedding of an H.265 stream in an MPEG2-TS transport stream. An RTP payload format specification for MPEG2-TS transport stream was developed through the IETF Payloads working group, IETF [RFC 2550][RFC-2550] for transport over RTP. Other normative documents may describe the requirements for the streaming of an MPEG2-TS transport stream over other non-RTP transports.

The [Society of Media Professionals, Technologists and Engineers][SMPTE] developed Standard [ST 2110-22][ST-2110-22] of the ST 2110 suite of protocols, which cover the end-to-end application use of constant bitrate compression for video over managed IP networks.
> Note that the definition of constant bitrate of ST 2110-22 is very strict "The video compression or the packetization of the video compression shall produce a constant number of bytes per frame. The packetization shall produce a constant number of RTP packets per frame.". This definition of constant bitrate is hereafter described as strict-CBR, using the H.265 definition of constant bitrate for CBR.

The [Video Services Forum][VSF] developed Technical Recommendation [TR-10-11][TR-10-11] and [TR-10-??][TR-10-??] of the IPMX suite of protocols, which cover the end-to-end application use of constant and variable bitrate compression for video, using the SMPTE ST 2110 and IPMX suite of protocols.

TR-10-11 and TR-10-?? mandate the use of the AMWA [IS-04][IS-04] and [IS-05][IS-05] NMOS Specifications in IPMX compliant systems.

AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 already have support for RTP transport and can signal the media type `video/H265` as defined in RFC 6184.

## Use of Normative Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC-2119].

## Definitions

The NMOS terms 'Controller', 'Node', 'Source', 'Flow', 'Sender', 'Receiver' are used as defined in the [NMOS Glossary](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos/main/docs/Glossary.html).

The term 'strict-CBR' corresponds to the definition of constant bit-rate at section 4 "Video Compression and Packetization" of the ST 2110-22 standard.

The terms CBR and VBR are defined in the [ITU-T H.265][H.265] | ISO/IEC 23008 standard.
